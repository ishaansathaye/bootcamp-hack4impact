## Bootcamp #2: Box Model and Git

### Box Model
- Every block level HTML has 4 layers
    - Content: where text exists
    - Padding: Wraps around content, does not include text but is colored by background color
    - Border: thin rim separating padding from margin
    - Margin: outermost layer, keeps separation between boxes
- DIV tag
    - div is a regular HTML element
    - used to group together elements and format them
```html
<div>
```
- Box Styling
    - width/height - changes size of content
    - border - changes width, style, and color of box border
    - border-radius - round corners of border
    - padding/margin
- Using Flexbox (Refer to flexbox resources)

### Git and Github (Refer to Git-Commands Repo)
